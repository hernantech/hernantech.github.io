<h1>{{ "Bootleg Bloomy" | downcase }}</h1>

The purpose of this project is to create financial insights similar to the functionality of Bloomberg terminal, with a primary focus on options pricing for traders to find over/underpriced contracts for any ticker (i.e., $SPY, $AAPL, $BA, etc.). Visualizations allow for one to quickly identify mispricings with excess liquidity and thereafter enter orders to scalp off of the pricing inefficiencies (using their respective brokerages).
